=================
The first two variables of the tidy dataset (tidyData.txt) are

activityName (text)
- describes one of six activities (LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, WALKING_UPSTAIRS)

subjectNumber (numeric)
- a unique identifier for each of the thirty individuals measured

The remaining variables relate to measurements gathered from accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 

These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions - i.e. there are three values for each variable listed with "-XYZ", an X value a Y value and a Z value.

The tidy dataset provided does not contain the original recorded data but contains the standard deviation and the mean for each variable for the relevant subject and activity type. These are listed with the suffix "-mean()" or "-std()" as appropriate
